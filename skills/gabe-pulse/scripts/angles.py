"""ANGLE signals — which satellite would find something, right now.

    python3 angles.py [<repo-root>] [--one-line] [--json] [--why]

The problem this exists for, in the operator's words: *"they will get buried by
my lack of awareness while I use only the router-dispatched commands."* Fifteen
of the suite's twenty-eight skills have nothing that fires them. Adding
"consider /gabe-roast" to every beat would fix nothing — a line that prints
every time carries no information about THIS run and the eye learns to skip it.

So a signal only earns its line when the repo state says the satellite would
find something. Not "consider a roast" but "6 phases done, no adversarial pass
since this plan started". Every signal below is computed from committed state,
never inferred, and a signal whose source is missing reports **unavailable with
the reason** rather than staying quiet — a silent signal is indistinguishable
from a clean one.

`--one-line` prints AT MOST ONE row, formatted for a beat's terminal report:

    PULSE: 6 phases done, no adversarial pass on this plan → /gabe-roast Sweeper "<subject>"

and prints NOTHING when there is nothing. There is no "all clear" line: a beat
that ends with a reassurance every run has re-invented the noise this avoids.
