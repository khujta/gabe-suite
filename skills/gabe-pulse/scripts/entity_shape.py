"""Entity-shape drift — the URL-domain ↔ entity-model cross-tab.

A PURE function (plus a thin CLI) that names two model defects the tracing tool
cares about:

  * DETACHED domain — a URL surface (`/settings`) that no *domain* entity owns; it
    falls to a cross-cutting aspect, so a workflow traces to the wrong place.
    (The JSON key is `orphans` — a contract three callers read; the reader-facing
    word is DETACHED, ruling R10.)
  * ASPECT entity — a cross-cutting concern (`allergen`) modeled as a peer
    domain: it co-claims many URL domains yet solely-owns almost none.

Report-only. There is NO stored artifact — every caller (pulse, review, cc-init)
computes fresh from its own already-fresh source, so nothing can go stale and
nothing needs remembering. See docs/design/ for the operability rationale.

HAZARD (entity models Phase 3, 2026-09-06): the ASPECT half of this module STAYS even though pulse S9 now
reports the EMITTER's measured aspects (gate fan-in) instead of the URL co-claim rule. Reason: `owned`
below is defined AGAINST `aspect_set`, and `owned` feeds `classify_new_routes` → /gabe-review's ENTITY-SHAPE
DRIFT subject and `mcp__gabe-map__entity_shape diff` on every project. Removing or changing the aspect rule
here silently changes review verdicts everywhere. It is reporting-only in pulse; it is a CLASSIFIER in review.

Battery: tests/entity-drift/run.sh guards this module (fire and silent fixtures) — run it after any edit here,
and tests/pulse-angles for the S9 line it feeds.
