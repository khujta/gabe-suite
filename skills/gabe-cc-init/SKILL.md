# Gabe Adopt — the back-catalog, at human speed

**Usage:** `/gabe-cc-init init | rank | section <entity> | status`

## Gabe execution contract (E1–E7)

This skill runs under the suite execution contract — E1 EVIDENCE · E2 RUN-BEFORE-✅ · E3 NO SILENT DOWNGRADE · E4 REUSE FIRST · E5 STATE SYNC · E6 MISSING ANCHOR = STOP · E7 REPORT WHERE — floors, not ceilings; a skill's own gate may be stricter, never looser. Full text: `../gabe-docs/references/execution-contract.md` (if that file is missing, E6 applies — STOP).

## The intention

*A project that grew before the center existed has features, tests, and documentation nobody can see in one place. This skill adopts that back-catalog — but never by bulk import: legacy prose is raw material to re-verify, not truth to copy. It archives what exists (never deletes), bootstraps a clean-slate center, lets the machine rank what matters, and then ingests ONE section per run so the operator can check every diagram, doc, test angle, and proof at human speed before it counts. Meanwhile the main plan keeps shipping — new features enter the center through `/gabe-cc-update`, and the two tracks converge.*

## Modes

| Mode | What it does | Gate |
|------|--------------|------|
| **init** | Inventory existing docs + any hand-built center → operator picks what gets ARCHIVED (`docs/_archive/<date>-pre-adoption/`, moved never deleted) → bootstrap the center shell from suite `templates/center/` → write the adoption tracker | Archive list approved before any move |
| **rank** | Machine-derive the candidate entity list (SCOPE, PLAN incl. archives, routes/modules, test density, churn, walks) → propose critical/high/medium; lists `model_census.unclaimed` — table classes no entity claims — plus `route_census`/`file_census.unclaimed` — route + backend files no entity claims, reach-nearest first (config = ownership, never existence); **the ENTITY-MODEL THIRD LENS** (2c, advisory): the drafter's `entities.draft.json` — a verdict per declared entity (FEATURE · SPLIT · MERGE · ASPECT · LAYER) + NAMED candidate entities + the witness-coverage number; acceptance = one `entities.<slug>` edit, then `rank` again; STALE when the draft's head ≠ the map's | Operator trims + approves the shortlist; nothing unranked gets built, and no unclaimed table class, route or backend file is left silent |
| **section \<entity\>** | ONE entity per run: testing inventory (angles present, gaps NAMED) → legacy mining (carry forward only what re-verifies; list what was dropped) → build card/diagrams/testing page/proofs → regen, gate green → checklist | Operator approval, recorded as a walk (`adopt:<entity>`) |
| **status** | Render the adoption board from the tracker + walks.jsonl: approved / building / awaiting / pending, convergence, suggested next entity | — |

## Bindings (scripts this skill reaches for — a missing one is an E6 STOP, named)

| Binding | Path |
|---|---|
| Entity-model drafter (the `rank` third lens) | `~/.claude/skills/gabe-cc-update/scripts/draft-entities.py <root> [--json] [--model proposed\|derived] [--min N] [--naming <strategy>]` — projects the committed c4 `models` block into `docs/site/center/entities.draft.json` (a verdict per declared entity + named candidates + coverage); honest-empty ×4 |
| URL-domain lens (the `rank` second lens) | `mcp__gabe-map__entity_shape`, fallback `~/.claude/skills/gabe-pulse/scripts/entity_shape.py .` |
| The registry edit acceptance lands in | `docs/site/center/center.config.json` `entities.<slug>` — this skill has no scripts dir and gains none |
| The init mode's bootstrap | `templates/center/generators/bootstrap_center.sh <repo>` (installed: `~/.claude/templates/gabe/center/generators/bootstrap_center.sh`) — archive-never-delete init: generators → `scripts/`, shell, `center.config.json` skeleton, the ten `.gitignore` seeds |

## Procedure

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` (mode + optional entity). No mode → print `status` if a tracker exists, else the init pitch.
2. Read `references/adopt-spec.md` IN FULL before executing — the binding spec (tracker schema, archive rules, generator-promotion path, ranking signals, the section checklist, walk-recorded approval). If missing, E6 — STOP.
3. Run the mode. Every write is path-scoped; every checkpoint waits for the operator.

## Laws (inherited, applied to legacy content)

- **Anti-curation:** machine sources assert every count/verdict; authored prose only translates; gaps are named, never faked — and a legacy doc's claim enters the center ONLY after re-verifying against current code/tests. Bulk import of unverified prose is forbidden.
- **Anti-bloat:** the center stays derived; adoption state is one small tracker file; archived docs are referenced, never rebuilt.
- **One section per run, by design.** A request to batch sections is refused — human-speed review IS the feature.
- **The tracker never lives in PLAN.md.** `/gabe-next` and the active plan are untouched; adoption is the parallel back-catalog track.

## Output contract (E7)

Per mode: `init` → archive manifest + bootstrapped paths + tracker location; `rank` → the evidence-columned candidate table + approved shortlist; `section` → the built page paths, the checklist state, the dropped-claims list, and the walk line recorded on approval; `status` → the board. Every report ends with where state was written.

## Non-goals

- Does NOT cover freshly shipped phases (`/gabe-cc-update` owns the forward track and the PLAN `Center` cell).
- Does NOT place standalone doc pages (`/gabe-docsite`).
- Does NOT delete anything, ever — archive is `git mv` plus an explanatory README.
- Does NOT rank by opinion — every rank cites its machine signals; the operator overrides freely.
