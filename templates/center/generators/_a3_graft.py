"""The graft-wiring arm — the center's TOPOLOGY provider (slice 5, landed).

The suite runs two graph programs over the same source: the spine's graft index
(``graft/.graph/wiring.json`` — calls/imports/contains edges over python+ts+tsx,
rebuilt by every /gabe-red beat) and this center's archmap (domain semantics —
entities, FK columns, HTTP surfaces, guards, tests). The 2026-08-12 gap analysis
settled the split: **graft owns topology, the archmap owns domain**, joined on
repo-relative file paths. This module is the join.

What it does, in order:
  * ``ensure_index`` — SELF-PROVISION: refresh the index with the red beat's exact
    recipe (``graft build`` then drop the hazardous repo-root ``.ignore``) whenever
    the binary exists, so "when is it updated" has one answer: every red beat AND
    every center regen. A dry-run sets ``allow_build=False`` and reads as-found —
    the build WRITES to the repo, and a twin's dirty tree must never be touched.
  * ``load_wiring`` — read + fingerprint the index (sha256 of the bytes — the file
    itself carries no git sha and no wallclock; byte-identical rebuilds are graft's
    own contract, so the hash IS the version).
  * ``derive_cross`` — resolve edge endpoints (node id = ``path#symbol``) to files,
    files to entities (``entities.<slug>.files``), and keep the CROSS-entity
    ``calls``/``imports`` pairs the FK derivation cannot see.

Honesty laws (same as ``_a3_graph``):
  * No index / no binary → ``None`` + a REASON string; the FK-only graph must build
    byte-identical to the pre-graft output (the battery pins this).
  * Cross-file call edges are confidence:"inferred" BY GRAFT'S DESIGN (its resolver
    matches unique bare names; every cross-file call is a heuristic hit) — so the
    counts carried here are labeled a FLOOR, never a census, and the extracted/
    inferred split rides the stats for any renderer that wants to show trust.
  * ``.js``/``.mjs``/``.jsx`` node paths are build-output noise in measured indexes
    (over half of gustify's) — excluded; ``node_modules``/``dist``/``build`` too.
  * An edge target that is not a node id (graft keeps raw import specifiers like
    "react" when unresolved) is skipped, never guessed.

Deterministic: sorted aggregation over an index graft itself writes sorted; the
fingerprint is content-derived; nothing here reads a clock.
