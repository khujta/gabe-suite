"""_a3_levels.py — derive the rich LEVELS graph (window.GABE_LEVELS) the codebase
stations render, from the in-memory archmap + the already-built C4 graph.

The lab-native station renderer (level-lab grammar) reads ``window.GABE_LEVELS``:
entities · colours · L1 kind-edges · piece-level cross edges · per-entity pieces
(models · schemas · endpoints · intra FKs · USE-CASES · COMMUNITIES · use-fns) ·
FUNCTION nodes · USE edges · schema owners · per-element dossier detail.

Provenance (the flip, 2026-08-13): the station used to re-implement the lab grammar
over the slim ``GABE_C4`` topology, so the function / use-case / community lenses
were empty. This module feeds the ITERATED lab renderer directly instead — and the
rich lenses are NOT new data: they come from insight blocks the suite's own
``_a3_code`` already writes into the archmap on every build:

  * ``function_insight`` (per fn: entity · file · layer · god · handler · lines) → ``fn_nodes``
  * ``model_insight.internal_refs`` (which fns reference a model class)          → ``use_edges`` · ``usefns``
  * ``model_insight`` (fan-in ``usage`` · ``god``)                              → per-model ``hub``
  * ``guard_insight`` (declared validators per file)                            → per-endpoint ``guards``
  * ``test_insight`` (carried on each C4 node's ``det.cases``)                  → per-piece ``tests``
  * endpoint URL first segment                                                 → ``usecases``
  * intra FK ∪ shared-touch components                                          → ``communities``

Only the function CALL edges (``fn_edges``, the Layers wires — cross-file, plus a drawn
function's calls into its own file, rule 3b3) need the graft index; they are
honest-empty when the arm is absent. Everything else
is pure archmap + C4 derivation — the same data, one host without a graft binary.

Determinism: a pure function of (amap, graph, graft index fp) with every list sorted;
same inputs ⇒ byte-identical output. Honest-empty: a missing insight block yields the
empty field, never a fabricated value; the lab degrades on its own ``||[]`` fallbacks.

Battery: tests/levels/run.sh (derive + honest-empty + determinism, mutation-proven).
