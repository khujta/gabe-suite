# Gabe Universe station battery — a STATIC/STRUCTURAL executable contract for the
# twin center's "Gabe Universe" station (templates/center/shell/gabe-universe.html):
# the 5C 3D graph (lifted from the graft-adoption spike) fed LIVE by window.GABE_C4,
# with the element-components card ported to read the real per-node dossier (det).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS: the render gates never EXECUTE the station's inline engine, and a
# whole class of bug ships green — the data feed dropped, the live card reverting to
# a toy field, the chip-class collision, the journeys field-mismatch (j.entities vs the
# card's old j.to). This battery is node-stdlib/grep only (no browser required), zero-arg,
# and the doctor auto-runs it. Every invariant ships as a FIRE+SILENT pair where the
# structural form allows (a positive present-assert + a guard on the known-bad pattern).
# An OPTIONAL headless-chrome render proof runs against the committed example feed when
# playwright-core + google-chrome-stable are present; it SKIPs loudly otherwise
# (nothing-to-verify is not the same as verified).
# Exit 0 = all pass.
