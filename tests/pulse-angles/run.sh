#
# This mechanism exists to stop fifteen manual-only skills from being buried by
# the operator's own habits, and it is worth exactly as much as its triggers are
# trustworthy. A signal that fires on a clean repo trains the reader to ignore
# the line; a signal that stays quiet on a dirty one is why the satellite got
# buried in the first place. So every live signal is pinned BOTH ways against a
# synthetic repo, plus the three rules the mechanism lives or dies on:
#   · at most ONE line in --one-line mode
#   · SILENCE when nothing fires (no "all clear" reassurance)
#   · DECAY actually silences a repeated offer
#
# Hermetic: builds throwaway git repos in a temp dir. Exit 0 = all pass.
